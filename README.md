# azure-data-engineering-end-to-end
## Overview
This project uses Kafka to implement a comprehensive end-to-end data engineering solution for real-time stock market data. The architecture incorporates various technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL. Building a real-time stock market data engineering project using Kafka involves designing a system to ingest, process, and analyze stock market data in real-time. Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, can be a key component in handling the data streaming aspect of this project. Here's a high-level overview of how you could approach this project
